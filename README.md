## Introduction
This project investigates the relationship between the height of the liquid column inside a straw immersed in a liquid bath and time following the sudden release of a cap covering the straw.

## Methodology
- **Experimental Setup**: Container filled with water, straw capped at one end, high-speed camera for recording oscillations.
- **Data Collection**: Record oscillations, use video analysis software for data extraction.
- **Modeling Dynamics**: Apply Newton's second law with a damping coefficient, solve the differential equation numerically.
- **Comparison and Analysis**: Compare experimental data with model predictions, adjust damping coefficient.

## Results
- **Observations**: Oscillations depend on initial liquid height, with damping effects reducing amplitude over time.
- **Model Predictions**: Liquid column oscillates around an equilibrium point, with amplitude decreasing due to damping.

## Conclusion
The study provides insights into the liquid column height relationship over time, with the model showing good agreement with experimental data after adjustments.

## Contributions
- **Om Singh**: Conducted experiments, collected data.
- **Rutam Rajhansa**: Developed theoretical model, performed data analysis.
